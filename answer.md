**1. Working Mechanism of Virtual Machines (Virtualization):**
    Virtulization is the process of creating virtual computing environment with the help of virtualization software, known as hypervisor. Hypervisor runs on the top of the Host Operating system to run image of guest operating system. Hypervisor acts as a mediator, as a controller, and a interface provider. Hypervisor allows a user to allocate fixed amount of disk space (storage), temporary storage (RAM), processor, network interface, and all other required hardware components, virtually, which virtual machine borrows from the host system. Virtual Machins work as a separate computing environment with some dedicated hardware components and its own separate operating system. Virtual machine cannot interfare with the host system as it is isolated from the host operating system.
